State: The 6 main steps in the data wrangling process	Discovery. Structure. Cleansing. Enrichment. Validation. Publishing
Explain: Discovery	Initial step of understanding the data and fully understanding what the data is about and understanding the data will enable the best outcomes for its analysis
Explain: Structure	Most data is unstructured and disorganised so it must be give na structure to make sure it is accessible and this structure will depend on the requirements of the output for analysis.
Explain: Cleansing	Remove any anomalies from the data and make sure that it does not skew the final analysis if the requirements are not fully met. Cleansing will also remvoe any formatting anomalies from varied collection methods.
Explain: Enrichment	If data that has been collected not fully meet the requirements, then one solution is data enrichment (or combining data sets). Enrichment of data involves adding or combining data sets so that the results of processing and analysis meet requirements fully. Data enrichment can be beneficial by saving a company by reducing the amount of primary data needing to be collected.
Explain: Validation	Checking the reliability, quality and safety of the data is authenticated. This means checking the data to ensure it is complete and all data in a given field meets the same structure and level of completeness that is required.
Explain: Publishing	The data output is full and complete and will enable analysis to be carried out. When publishing, the data must be made appopriately accessible.
